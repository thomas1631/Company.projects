## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing procurement data to understand the main drivers of profit and revenue. The analysis includes data exploration, cleaning, transformation, visualization, and generating actionable insights.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

1. **SQL Data Cleaning**: 
   - Imported raw data into a SQL database.
   - Performed initial data cleaning, including removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting data types.
   - Identified key metrics like `Order Value`, `Revenue`, and `Profit`.

2. **Data Profiling**:
   - Conducted a data profiling exercise to understand the distribution, outliers, and patterns in key columns such as `Supplier Name`, `Commodity Description`, `Order Type`, and `Procurement Category`.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Applied normalization and calculated derived columns such as `Adjusted Profit` (considering a 5% rebate from preferred suppliers).
   - Extracted and transformed text fields like `Agility.AssetDescription` to identify patterns and groupings.

## Data Analysis

1. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Used Python to calculate the correlation between various factors and profit.
   - Identified the 'Value Bracket' as the highest correlated factor with profit after adjusting for rebates.

2. **Variance Analysis**:
   - Performed variance analysis on categorical variables to understand their impact on profitability.
   - Analyzed main drivers in the most correlated column (`Value Bracket`).

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Developed a regression model to quantify the impact of key variables on profit.
   - Identified the most significant predictors of profitability.

## Data Visualization with Power BI

- Created a Power BI dashboard to monitor revenue and profit drivers in real time.
- Visualizations include:
  - **Revenue by Value Bracket**: Bar chart highlighting the most profitable brackets.
  - **Profit Trends**: Line chart showing month-over-month profit trends.
  - **Supplier Performance**: Matrix chart comparing preferred vs. non-preferred suppliers.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

1. **Focus on Low to Mid Value Brackets**:
   - The majority of profit comes from orders within the £0 to £5,000 range. Maximizing orders in this range will boost profitability.

2. **Optimize High Value Orders**:
   - High-value orders (over £15,001) should be reviewed for efficiency and cost-saving opportunities.

3. **Improve Supplier Negotiations**:
   - Leverage the 5% rebate from preferred suppliers more effectively.

4. **Enhance Operational Efficiency**:
   - Streamline processes for high-frequency, low-value orders to reduce costs and improve margins.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and cleaning.
- **Python**: For data analysis, correlation, variance analysis, and modeling.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
